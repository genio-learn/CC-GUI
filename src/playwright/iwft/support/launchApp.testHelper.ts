// Boot the real frontend with the backend faked. Two init scripts run before any
// page script (Playwright preserves add order): first the seed, then the bundled
// simulator that reads it and installs mockIPC. Then navigate and wait for the
// seeded sidebar to paint, which also confirms get_groups was answered. The
// group-by bar renders unconditionally (even with zero projects/sessions —
// see onboarding/firstRun.iwft.ts), so it's the readiness signal rather than
// a session row.
